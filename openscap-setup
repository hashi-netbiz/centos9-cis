### [1] Install the required packages:
        dnf -y install openscap-scanner scap-security-guide

### [2] SCAP Security Guide is installed under the [/usr/share/xml/scap/ssg/content] directory: 
        ll /usr/share/xml/scap/ssg/content/ 

### [3] display description for each content: This displays all the security profiles implemented by oscap.
        oscap info /usr/share/xml/scap/ssg/content/ssg-cs9-ds.xml 
        
### [4] Scan CentOS System with [oscap] command. This based on server level 1 security checks only
        Scan result is generated as HTML report, verify it and try to apply recommended settings as much as possible:
        oscap xccdf eval \
        --profile xccdf_org.ssgproject.content_profile_cis_server_l1 \
        --results ssg-cs9-ds.xml \
        --report ssg-cs9-ds.html \
        --fetch-remote-resources \
        /usr/share/xml/scap/ssg/content/ssg-cs9-ds.xml 

### [5] Check the html report and rename as ssg-cs9-ds-existing.html
##      copy the html file to the context user home directory as below:
        cp ssg-cs9-ds-existing.html /home/user/ssg-cs9-ds-existing.html
        
##      transfer the newly created report from the VM to local environment to view:
##      Run the copy command on your desktop
        scp user@ip or host:/home/user/ssg-cs9-ds-existing.html ./        

### [6] generate remediation script from scaned result.
        Remediation script will change various system settings, so you must take care if you run it, especially for production systems.
       
        ## make sure the [Result ID] in the result output on [4]
        oscap info ssg-cs9-ds.xml | grep "Result ID" 
        
        ## generate remediation script
        oscap xccdf generate fix \
        --fix-type ansible \
        --output ssg-cs9-ds-remediation-playbook.yml \
        --result-id xccdf_org.open-scap_testresult_xccdf_org.ssgproject.content_profile_cis_server_l1 \   
        ssg-cs9-ds.xml 
        
        ## copy the newly created ansible playbook file to the context user's home directory
        cp ssg-cs9-ds-remediation-playbook.yml /home/user/ssg-cs9-ds-remediation-playbook-existing.yml
        
        ## change the file ownership. Replace {CONTEXT-USER} with actual centos local user
        sudo chown {CONTEXT-USER} ssg-cs9-ds-remediation-playbook-existing.yml
        
##      transfer the newly created playbook file from the VM to the local desktop environment to view:
##      Run the copy command on your desktop 
        scp user@ip or host:/home/user/ssg-cs9-ds-remediation-playbook-existing.yml ./ 
        
##      Open the downloaded ansible file in visual studio code and edit the file to comform to the recommendations on
##      the openscap ticket (LINK TO TICKET).

##      Rename the modified ansible file as ssg-cs9-ds-remediation-playbook-new.yml

##      Upload playbook back to the VM. Run the following command on your desktop from the directory where the updated 
#       playbook is located. Replace {CONTEXT-USER} with actual centos local user
        scp ssg-cs9-ds-remediation-playbook-new.yml {CONTEXT-USER}@ip or host:/home/{CONTEXT-USER}
        
##      CD into VM root directory and EXECUTE the following command
##      cp /home/{CONTEXT-USER}/ssg-cs9-ds-remediation-playbook-new.yml ssg-cs9-ds-remediation-playbook-new.yml        
        
        # run remediation script
        # install ansible-core. Since sysctl module is not included, install this module via ansible-galaxy 
        dnf install ansible-core -y
        ansible-galaxy collection install ansible.posix
        
        # update hosts file located at /etc/ansible/hosts and append the following line
        

        # execute ansible playbook to install CIS benchmarks and remediate
        
        # replace 'sysctl:' with 'ansible.posix.sysctl:' in remediation playbook       
        sed 's/sysctl:/ansible.posix.sysctl:/g'  ssg-cs9-ds-remediation-playbook.yml 
        
        #run playbook
        ansible-playbook ./ssg-cs9-ds-remediation-playbook.yml
        
 ### [7] Re-run the HTML report and check the result:
        oscap xccdf eval \
        --profile xccdf_org.ssgproject.content_profile_cis_server_l1 \
        --results ssg-cs9-ds.xml \
        --report ssg-cs9-ds.html \
        --fetch-remote-resources \
        /usr/share/xml/scap/ssg/content/ssg-cs9-ds.xml
